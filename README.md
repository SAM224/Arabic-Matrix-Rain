# Arabic Matrix Rain
A simple simulation of the Digital Rain sequence from [The Matrix](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/) using arabic symbols.

This is based on Xie's [Green rain](https://github.com/emilyxxie/green_rain). Special thanks to her.

I used the yellow color to give the taste of visuals found in [The Blue Elephant](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3461252/).
